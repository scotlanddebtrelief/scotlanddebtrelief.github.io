seriously. We   have a strong commitment to providing excellent service 
to all our   customers and visitors of this Web Site, including 
respecting your   concerns about privacy. This Privacy Policy discloses 
how we collect,   protect, use and share information gathered about you 
on our website. If   you use this site you explicitly agree to the terms
 and conditions of   the Privacy Policy in effect at the time of your 
use. We hope that this   disclosure will help increase your confidence 
in our website and enhance   your experience on the Internet. Therefore,
 in compliance with industry   standards and regulations enforced 
typically by the Federal and   Provincial Governments, we abide the 
following privacy policy.</p>
        <p><strong>Browsing</strong></p>
        <p>This website does not collect personally identifiable 
information   from your computer when you browse this website and 
request pages from   our servers. This means that, unless you 
voluntarily and knowingly   provide us with personally identifiable 
information, we will not know   your name, your email address, or any 
other personally identifiable   information. We may use IP addresses, 
browser types and access times to   analyze trends, administer the site,
 improve site performance and gather   broad demographic information for
 aggregate use. When you request a   page from our website, our servers 
log the information provided in the   HTTP request header including the 
IP number, the time of the request,   the URL of your request, and other
 information that is provided in the   HTTP header. We collect the HTTP 
request header information in order to   make our website function 
correctly and provide you the functionality   that you see on this 
website. We also use this information to better   understand how 
visitors use our website and how we can better tune it,   its contents 
and functionality to meet your needs. </p>
        <p><strong>Information We Collect and Its Uses</strong></p>
        <p>We collect your personal information if you decide to 
purchase one of   our products or retain our services, participate in 
our affiliate   marketing program, subscribe to our newsletter, complete
 an application   form, participate in one of our surveys or transact 
other business with   us. We need to collect personally identifiable 
information from you to   execute the requested transaction, provide you
 with a particular   service, and/or to further enhance your account. At
 anytime, we may ask   you to voluntarily supply us with additional 
information needed. We will   ask you for information such as, but not 
limited to: name, current   and/or billing address, your e-mail address,
 telephone number and, if   you purchase one of our products or 
services, a valid credit card   number, your Social Security number and 
certain other personal   information, such as your date of birth, 
address, employment   information, and certain credit card and loan 
account information. We   may use your email address to send a 
confirmation and, if necessary, we   might use the other information to 
contact you for help in processing.   In addition, when you provide 
contact details for transaction requests   such as scheduling an 
appointment or requesting a proposal, we will use   the contact 
information to keep you updated about future offers or   promotions 
unless you opt-out online or otherwise notify us. We may also   use the 
information we collect about you in order to, but not limited   to: </p>
        <p>&#8226; learn more about your interest in the products or services we offer and provide you with information; </p>
        <p>&#8226; enroll customers who desire our services </p>

        <p>&#8226; learn how to improve our products or services </p>
        <p>&#8226; provide opportunities for our affiliates and other 
companies to   inform you about the products or services they offer that
 may interest   you </p>
        <p>&#8226; to share aggregated statistical data with our business 
partners or   for public relations. For example, we may disclose that a 
specific   percentage of our users are between the ages of 25 and 35. </p>
        <p>Aside from the ways mentioned above, we may use your 
personally   identifiable information in many other ways, including 
sending you   promotional materials, and sharing your information with 
third parties   so that these third parties can send you promotional 
materials. (By   "promotional materials," we mean communications that 
directly promote   the use of Web sites, or the purchase of products or 
services.).   However, you may "opt-out" of certain uses of your 
personal information.</p>

        <p><strong>Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</strong></p>
		
		<p>We may disclose a consumer's personally identifiable information in order to effect or carry out any transaction that you have requested of us or as necessary to complete our contractual obligations with you. We may be compensated for this disclosure by our third-party partners. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO SELL, RENT OR TRANSFER YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES FOR ANY PURPOSE IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION. These companies may employ the use of an Automated Dialing-Announcing Device (ADAD) to make contact with you. We prohibit the sale or transfer of personal information to non-affiliated entities for their use without giving you the opportunity to opt-out (See Opt-Out below). We may share your personally identifiable information with affiliated companies that are directly or indirectly controlled by, or under common control of Debt Advisors. We may send personally identifiable information about you to non-affiliated companies that are not directly or indirectly controlled by, or under common control of, Debt Advisors. The personal information collected on this site and by third parties will be used to operate the site and to provide the services or products or carry out the transactions you have requested or authorized. We may change or broaden the use of your personal information at any time. We and/or our third-party partners may use your personal information to provide promotional offers to you by means of email advertising, telephone marketing, use of an Automated Dialing-Announcing Device (ADAD), direct mail marketing, banner advertising, text messages at the phone number(s) you provide, and other possible uses. You can, however, have your name put on our do-not-share list by, writing to us at the email address listed below.</p>
		

        <p><strong>Choice/Opt-out</strong></p>
        <p>We provide you the opportunity to &#8216;opt-out&#8217; of having your 
personally   identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we
 ask for   this information. For example, if you purchase a 
product/service but do   not wish to receive any additional marketing 
material from us, you can   indicate your preference on our order form. 
If you no longer wish to   receive our newsletter and promotional 
communications, you may opt-out   of receiving them by following the 
instructions included in each   newsletter or communication or by 
emailing or calling us per the   information contained on our contact 
page. If you do not wish to have   your personal information collected 
by any third party that is not our   agent/service provider, please 
contact our customer service department   to actively opt-out of having 
your personal information shared. Customer   Service Contact

        <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p>
        <p>We may use other third parties to provide certain clerical 
and   information processing and shipping services on our site. When you
 sign   up for our services, we will share only as much information as 
is   necessary for the provision of those services. These third parties 
are   prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for
 any   other purpose.</p>
        <p><strong>Securing the Transmission and Storage of Information</strong></p>
        <p>The security of your personal information is extremely 
important to   us. We employ generally accepted industry standards to 
protect the   personal information submitted to us, both during 
transmission and once   we receive it. Our site uses SSL (Secure Sockets
 Layer) security   technology to encrypt information you provide to us 
through the site   when entering sensitive information (such as credit 
card number and/or   social security number) on our registration or 
order forms. This ensures   that your information is encrypted as it 
travels over the Internet. SSL   is an industry-standard protocol for 
encryption over the internet.   After information reaches 
Debt Advisors, it is stored on a secure server   that resides 
behind firewalls designed to block unauthorized access from   outside of
 Debt Advisors . You can help to maintain the security of your   
online transactions by not sharing your personal information or password
   with anyone. Remember, no method of transmission over the Internet, 
or   method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. (Example: any 
information   you provide us by email is not encrypted) Therefore, while
 we strive to   use commercially acceptable means to protect your 
personal information,   we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If 
you have any questions   about the security on our Web site, please feel
 free to e-mail us.</p>
        <p><strong>Log Files</strong></p>
        <p>As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information  
 automatically and store it in log files. This information includes   
internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service   
provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp,
   and click stream data. We use this information, which does not 
identify   individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, 
to track   users&#8217; movements around the site and to gather demographic 
information   about our user base as a whole. We do not link this   
automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.</p>
        <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
        <p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user&#8217;s 
computer for   record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We 
do not link   the information we store in cookies to any personally 
identifiable   information you submit while on our site. We use session 
ID cookies. We   use session cookies to make it easier for you to 
navigate our site. A   session ID cookie expires when you close your 
browser. We can at your   option set a persistent cookie to store your 
passwords, so you don&#8217;t   have to enter it more than once. Persistent 
cookies also enable us to   track and target the interests of our users 
to enhance the experience on   our site. If you reject cookies, you may 
still use our site, but your   ability to use some areas of our site, 
such as contests or surveys, will   be limited. Some of our business 
partners (e.g., advertisers) use   cookies on our site. We have no 
access to or control over these cookies.   This privacy statement covers
 the use of our cookies only and does not   cover the use of cookies by 
any advertisers.</p>
        <p><strong>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</strong></p>
        <p>We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web
   Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by 
  informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics  
 with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used 
  to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies,   
which are stored on a user&#8217;s computer hard drive, clear gifs are   
embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at 
  the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by   
clear gifs to our customers&#8217; personally identifiable information. We use
   clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have 
  been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness 
of   certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing 
campaigns.   If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see 
"Choice and   Opt-out."</p>

	<p><strong>Terms & Conditions</strong></p>

<p>Important: After filling out the form on our website you 
will be contacted by phone, email or both by Debt Advisors and/or 
 up to three of our debt partners for a free debt consultation. The purpose of your 
consultation will be to help determine if you qualify for a debt 
relief program, provide you with information and answer any 
questions you may have. Additionally, you may be added to the Debt Advisors 
email newsletter and that of our debt partners. These newsletters will contain information, 
tips and advice to help you become debt free as well as special promotions related to the same. 
You may withdraw your consent to receive email from Debt Advisors by clicking the "unsubscribe" 
link located at the bottom of every email or emailing support@scotlanddebtrelief.com with your request
to be removed from our list. You may also withdraw your consent to receive email from each of our 
debt partners individually by clicking the "unsubscribe" link in their emails or by responding
to any email received requesting to be removed from their list.
</p>
<p>You  are under no obligation to make a purchase
 by taking part in a free consultation. If you qualify for and choose 
to participate in a debt relief program, your individual results 
may vary. Settlement  estimates of 50 - 75% are examples of past 
performance and are not   intended to be a guarantee of future 
results. Program fees and  commitment length will also vary 
dependent on the amount that your debt   can be reduced and your ability
 to save funds. </p>
